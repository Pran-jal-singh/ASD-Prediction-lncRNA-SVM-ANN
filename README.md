# ASD-Prediction-lncRNA-SVM-ANN
Leveraging lncRNA Profiles for Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction: SVM vs. ANN Models

This project focuses on predicting and prioritizing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques. ASD is characterized by neurodevelopmental challenges, including difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Although the molecular mechanisms of ASD are not yet fully understood, recent studies indicate that lncRNAs may play a significant role in regulating genes linked to brain development and function.

This system leverages machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict ASD-associated lncRNAs. The project integrates diverse datasets, such as developmental brain gene expression profiles and protein-coding transcript sequences, to enhance prediction accuracy. Data augmentation techniques, including manual oversampling and Gaussian noise addition, were applied to balance class distribution and create a more robust dataset for training.
