Leveraging lncRNA Profiles for Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction: SVM vs. ANN Models
This project investigates the potential involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through the application of machine learning techniques. By leveraging datasets such as developmental brain gene expression profiles and protein-coding transcript sequences, this project aims to predict and prioritize lncRNAs associated with ASD risk genes.

Two machine learning models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), were implemented and compared for their predictive capabilities. Both models achieved strong accuracy, with the ANN reaching 90% accuracy and the SVM slightly outperforming with an accuracy of 96%.

The findings offer a prioritized list of candidate lncRNAs for further experimental validation, providing a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD.
